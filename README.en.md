## Overview

OpenTalking is an open-source real-time digital-human framework. The goal is to wire up everything a **digital-human conversational product** needs: frontend interaction, session state, LLM replies, TTS / voice selection, barge-in control, subtitle events, WebRTC media playback, and calls into external model services.

OpenTalking focuses on the **pipeline orchestration layer** and supports both external API providers and locally deployed models. The default entrypoint is optimized for getting a first working loop quickly, then upgrading model quality as needed:

- **Quick experience**: `demo-avatar / wav2lip`, no standalone model service required, ideal for validating the API, TTS, WebRTC, and frontend.
- **Lightweight adapter validation**: `wav2lip / musetalk`, useful for Avatar assets, model adapters, and end-to-end orchestration checks.
- **High-quality deployment**: FlashTalk-compatible WebSocket via [OmniRT](https://github.com/datascale-ai/omnirt), targeting consumer GPUs and enterprise private inference services.

## Capabilities

- **Real-time digital-human dialogue**: LLM reply, streaming TTS, subtitle events, status events, and WebRTC playback all happen in one pipeline.
- **FlashTalk-compatible path**: speaks the FlashTalk WebSocket protocol, with either local or remote inference servers behind it as the high-quality renderer.
- **Lightweight demo path**: the API, TTS, WebRTC, and frontend can be exercised without first downloading the full FlashTalk weights.
- **Basic barge-in**: current speaking turns can already be interrupted; full pipeline cancellation is on the roadmap.
- **OpenAI-compatible LLM**: works with DashScope, Ollama, vLLM, DeepSeek, and any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **Multiple deployment shapes**: single-process demo, distributed API + Worker mode, and Docker Compose.

## Demo videos

These demo videos show how the OpenTalking pipeline behaves across different real-time digital-human scenarios. The landscape clip spans the full width on its own row; portrait clips follow so row height is not dominated by the landscape video (which can make portrait previews look vertically clipped).

```

## Quickstart

OpenTalking's **orchestration layer** (API + Worker + frontend) and the **inference service** ([OmniRT](https://github.com/datascale-ai/omnirt)) deploy independently—they can run on the same host or on different hosts. The three paths below are organised by *what you want to do*. For Docker, see [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.en.md).

### Step 0 (shared): install the orchestration layer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datascale-ai/opentalking.git && cd opentalking
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env
```

Requirements: Python ≥ 3.10, Node.js ≥ 18, FFmpeg.

> Run `opentalking-doctor` any time to see what's missing.

### Path 1: Quick experience (recommended for first-run)

**Goal**: see the digital human chat in your browser within 5 minutes — **no GPU, no model service required**.
**How**: synthesis goes through the built-in Mock; LLM/STT/TTS use cloud APIs.

In `.env` you only need two things:

```env
# Enable Mock synthesis (uses the avatar reference image as static frames)
OPENTALKING_INFERENCE_MOCK=1

# LLM: DashScope / Bailian / any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
OPENTALKING_LLM_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
OPENTALKING_LLM_API_KEY=sk-your-key
OPENTALKING_LLM_MODEL=qwen-flash

# STT: reuses the same DashScope key
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-your-key

# TTS: defaults to Edge TTS, no key (nothing to change)
```

Two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: backend (single process, in-memory bus, no Redis)
opentalking-unified

# Terminal 2: frontend
cd apps/web && npm ci && npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and pick a built-in avatar. Frames are static (reference image)—**LLM reply, streaming TTS, subtitle events, and WebRTC delivery are real**; only lip-sync is faked.

### Path 2: Lightweight adapter validation

**Goal**: iterate on Avatar assets, validate model adapters, run real wav2lip / musetalk / flashtalk models.
**How**: run a SoulX FlashTalk WS inference service locally or remotely; OpenTalking connects directly.

Start a backend (OmniRT / FlashTalk / any compatible service):

```bash
# Local container (default cuda; for CPU set OMNIRT_BACKEND=cpu)
bash scripts/run_omnirt.sh

# Or remote: launch a SoulX FlashTalk service on a GPU server (see its upstream repo)
```

In `.env` drop the mock and point at the WebSocket:

```env
# OPENTALKING_INFERENCE_MOCK=0          # remove or comment out
OPENTALKING_FLASHTALK_WS_URL=ws://<host>:8765

OPENTALKING_DEFAULT_MODEL=flashtalk      # or musetalk / wav2lip (depending on what your backend serves)
```

> **`OPENTALKING_FLASHTALK_WS_URL` vs `OMNIRT_ENDPOINT`**: today the code talks directly to the FlashTalk WebSocket protocol (`OPENTALKING_FLASHTALK_WS_URL`). `OMNIRT_ENDPOINT` is a placeholder for a future unified HTTP API in OmniRT, **not yet wired**.

Start exactly the same way as Path 1 (`opentalking-unified` + frontend). Avatar asset format: see [docs/avatar-format.md](docs/avatar-format.md).

### Path 3: High-quality deployment

**Goal**: run FlashTalk 14B / FlashHead-class high-quality models for private deployments / production.
**How**: same `OPENTALKING_FLASHTALK_WS_URL` as Path 2, plus multi-process / Redis / GPU orchestration:

```env
OPENTALKING_FLASHTALK_WS_URL=ws://<gpu-host>:8765
OPENTALKING_DEFAULT_MODEL=flashtalk     # or flashhead

OPENTALKING_TORCH_DEVICE=cuda           # for orchestration-layer audio PCM acceleration
OPENTALKING_REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0    # multi-process needs a real Redis
```

Multi-process startup (recommended for production):

```bash
opentalking-api &
opentalking-worker &
# Build the frontend separately and serve via nginx
cd apps/web && npm ci && npm run build
```

Avatar manifest, inference endpoint mapping, hardware profiles: see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) and [docs/hardware.md](docs/hardware.md).

### Three paths at a glance

| Path | Inference backend | GPU | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Quick experience | Built-in Mock | not required | First-run, frontend dev, pipeline validation |
| 2. Lightweight adapter validation | Local OmniRT + lightweight model | entry-level GPU (3060+) | Model / Avatar adapter development |
| 3. High-quality deployment | OmniRT + FlashTalk/FlashHead | 4090 / 910B | Private deployment, production, high-quality |

### Supported models

| Model | Input | OpenTalking integration | Recommended path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mock` | reference image | Built-in static frames | Path 1 |
| `wav2lip` | frames + audio | OmniRT lightweight lip-sync | Path 2 |
| `musetalk` | full frames + audio | OmniRT lightweight talking-head | Path 2 |
| `soulx-flashtalk-14b` | portrait + audio | OmniRT high-quality FlashTalk | Path 3 |
| `soulx-flashhead-1.3b` | portrait + audio | direct FlashHead WebSocket | Path 3 |


## Roadmap

- [x] **Real-time digital-human baseline**  
  Web console, LLM dialogue, TTS, subtitle events, WebRTC media playback.

- [ ] **More natural realtime dialogue(in progress)**  
  Barge-in, session state, low-latency response, audio-video sync, error recovery.

- [ ] **OmniRT model service integration**  
  Unified access via OmniRT for FlashTalk, lightweight talking-head, ASR, speech synthesis, and voice services.

- [ ] **Consumer-grade GPU support**  
  Lightweight models, single-card realtime configs, end-to-end benchmarks for RTX 3090 / 4090.

- [ ] **High-quality private deployment(in progress)**  
  Enterprise private deployment with external OmniRT inference, capacity scheduling, health checks, production monitoring; Ascend 910B and similar enterprise GPU / NPU paths in progress.

- [ ] **Custom characters and voices**  
  Character config, built-in voice selection, reference audio upload, natural-language voice description, and OmniRT-driven voice synthesis.

- [ ] **Agent and memory capabilities**  
  Integration with OpenClaw or external agents to reuse their memory, tool use, and knowledge-base capabilities.

- [ ] **Production-grade platform**  
  Multi-session scheduling, observability, security and compliance, licensed voices, synthetic-content provenance.
