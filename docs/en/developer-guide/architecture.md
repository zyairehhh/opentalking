# Architecture

OpenTalking is an orchestration framework for real-time digital humans. It coordinates
speech recognition, language models, text-to-speech synthesis, talking-head rendering,
and WebRTC delivery within a unified session model. A small HTTP and WebSocket surface
is exposed on top.

This page describes the system-level architecture: components, deployment topologies,
session lifecycle, the event bus, and the pluggable synthesis backend boundary.

| Component | Responsibility | Source |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| `apps/api` | HTTP and WebSocket entry, session CRUD, WebRTC signaling, SSE event stream. | `apps/api/routes/` |
| `apps/worker` | Drives one or more sessions through the render pipeline. | `apps/worker/`, `opentalking/worker/` |
| `apps/unified` | Combines API, Worker, and an in-memory bus in one process. Intended for development. | `apps/unified/` |
| `opentalking/` library | Providers, adapters, interfaces, types, configuration, bus, and pipeline code. | `opentalking/` (flat layout) |
| Synthesis backend | Per-model runtime selected by the backend resolver: `mock`, `local`, `direct_ws`, or `omnirt`. | `opentalking/providers/synthesis/` |
| OmniRT (external) | Heavyweight, multi-card, GPU/NPU, and remote inference when a model uses `backend: omnirt`. | [datascale-ai/omnirt](https://github.com/datascale-ai/omnirt) |
| Redis (external) | Pub/sub bus between the API and one or more Workers. | Optional in unified mode. |

## Deployment topologies

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Topology A: Unified"
      direction TB
      U[apps/unified]
    end
    subgraph "Topology B: API + Worker"
      direction TB
      Aa[apps/api] --- Rr[(Redis)] --- Ww[apps/worker]
    end
    subgraph "Topology C: API + multiple Workers"
      direction TB
      Ab[apps/api] --- Rb[(Redis)]
      Rb --- Wb1[Worker 1]
      Rb --- Wb2[Worker 2]
      Rb --- Wb3[Worker N]
    end
```

Command-line specifics are documented in [Deployment](../user-guide/deployment.md).

## Session lifecycle

    participant Browser
    participant API
    participant Worker
    participant LLM
    participant TTS
    participant Model as Synthesis backend
    participant Redis

    Browser->>API: POST /sessions (avatar_id, model)
    API->>Redis: publish session.created
    Worker->>Redis: subscribe session events
    Browser->>API: POST /sessions/{id}/webrtc/offer
    API->>Worker: SDP exchange
    Worker-->>Browser: WebRTC track established

    Browser->>API: POST /sessions/{id}/speak
    API->>Redis: publish speak.request
    Worker->>LLM: stream tokens
    LLM-->>Worker: token deltas
    Worker->>TTS: synthesize each sentence
    TTS-->>Worker: audio bytes
    Worker->>Model: drive with audio
    Model-->>Worker: video frames
    Worker-->>Browser: AV frames over WebRTC
    Worker->>Redis: publish events (transcript, llm, tts, frame)
    API->>Browser: forward via SSE

    Browser->>API: POST /sessions/{id}/interrupt
    API->>Redis: publish cancel
    Worker->>Worker: drain and return to idle
```

## Event bus

The bus carries one logical channel per session and a global control channel. Events
are JSON-encoded; schemas are defined in `opentalking/core/types/events.py` and
`opentalking/events/schemas.py`.

| Event | Producer | Consumer |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `session.created` / `session.terminated` | API | Worker |
| `speak.request` | API | Worker |
| `cancel` | API | Worker |
| `transcript` | Worker | API → SSE |
| `llm` (token deltas) | Worker | API → SSE |
| `tts` (lifecycle markers) | Worker | API → SSE |
| `frame` (video frame timing) | Worker | API → SSE |
| `error` | Worker | API → SSE |

In unified mode the bus is in-memory; in split mode the bus uses Redis pub/sub.

## Boundaries

The following concerns are out of scope for OpenTalking:

| Concern | Location |
|---------|----------|
| Model execution and weight loading | Selected synthesis backend (`local`, `direct_ws`, or `omnirt`) |
| GPU and NPU scheduling, batching, multi-card orchestration | OmniRT when `backend: omnirt`; otherwise the selected backend's runtime |
| Language model hosting | User-selected endpoint (DashScope, OpenAI, vLLM, Ollama, etc.) |
| Text-to-speech hosting | User-selected provider (or local Edge TTS) |
| User authentication and account management | Out of scope; integrate via an upstream gateway. |
| WebRTC TURN | Out of scope; deploy `coturn` or an equivalent. |

The `apps/` entry points depend on the backend resolver rather than hard-coded model
sets. Lightweight models can remain in-process through `backend: local`, single-model
services can use `backend: direct_ws`, and production-grade heavy models can use
OmniRT without changing the session API.
