# Architecture Refactor Implementation Plan (2026-05-07)

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Reorganize the OpenTalking repo into the target architecture defined in `docs/architecture-review.md`: delete all in-repo local-inference code, restructure into `packages/opentalking/{core,providers,media,avatar,voice,pipeline,runtime}`, route synthesis exclusively through omnirt, and ship a one-click deploy path.

**Architecture:** Single decisive cut — no back-compat. Delete `engine/`, local model implementations, legacy ENV vars, and duplicate config trees. New layout with capability-flat `providers/`, avatar as aggregate root, pipeline as orchestrator host, omnirt as the only inference path. Final outcome: `bash scripts/install.sh docker` brings up redis + omnirt + api + worker + web and a built-in avatar can talk via the browser.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, Redis (or InMemoryRedis), aiortc, pytest, ruff, Docker Compose, omnirt (external inference service), React/Vite frontend (unchanged in this plan).

**Reference:** [docs/architecture-review.md](architecture-review.md) — read § 二 (decisions), § 三 (target layout), § 七 (config→runtime flow), § 八 (Week 1 deliverables) before starting.

**Scope note:** This plan covers Phases A–J below = the architecture refactor + minimum one-click deploy. It does **not** cover: catalog API + frontend dropdown wiring, full pipeline rewrite of `flashtalk_runner.py` 2528 lines into clean stages (only the orchestration shell is moved; deep splitting is a separate plan), Windows install path, benchmark CI. Those go into follow-up plans.

**Branch / worktree:** Run on a dedicated branch `refactor/architecture-v2` from main. Commit after every task. If any task fails verification, stop and ask before continuing.

---

## Phase A — Pre-flight & Baseline

### Task A1: Create branch and snapshot baseline test results

**Files:**
- Modify: git branch state

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the working branch**

```bash
git checkout -b refactor/architecture-v2
git status
```

Expected: clean working tree on `refactor/architecture-v2`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run baseline pytest and record output**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests apps/api/tests apps/worker/tests -q --tb=line 2>&1 | tee .baseline-pytest.txt | tail -20
```

Expected: capture pass/fail counts as the baseline. Tests that pass now must still pass at the end of the plan (excluding tests we explicitly delete because they cover removed code).

- [ ] **Step 3: Run baseline ruff**

```bash
.venv/bin/ruff check src apps tests 2>&1 | tee .baseline-ruff.txt | tail -5
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit baseline log files (will delete at the end)**

```bash
git add .baseline-pytest.txt .baseline-ruff.txt
git commit -m "chore: snapshot baseline test/lint output before refactor"
```

---

### Task A2: List every import site that depends on code we will delete

**Files:**
- Create: `.refactor-import-map.txt` (scratch file, deleted at end)

- [ ] **Step 1: Generate import map**

```bash
{
  echo "=== engine imports ==="
  grep -rln "opentalking\.engine\|from \.\.engine\|from \.engine" src apps tests 2>/dev/null
  echo ""
  echo "=== local FlashTalk impl imports ==="
  grep -rln "flashtalk\.local_adapter\|flashtalk\.local_client\|flashtalk\.idle_generator" src apps tests 2>/dev/null
  echo ""
  echo "=== local MuseTalk impl imports ==="
  grep -rln "musetalk\.adapter\|musetalk\.composer\|musetalk\.face_utils\|musetalk\.feature_extractor\|musetalk\.inference\|musetalk\.loader\|musetalk\.prepared_assets" src apps tests 2>/dev/null
  echo ""
  echo "=== local Wav2Lip impl imports ==="
  grep -rln "wav2lip\.network\|wav2lip\.layers\|wav2lip\.model_defs\|wav2lip\.audio\|wav2lip\.face_detection\|wav2lip\.feature_extractor\|wav2lip\.loader\|wav2lip\.official_runtime" src apps tests 2>/dev/null
  echo ""
  echo "=== FLASHTALK_MODE refs ==="
  grep -rn "FLASHTALK_MODE\|flashtalk_mode" src apps configs tests 2>/dev/null
  echo ""
  echo "=== voices/bailian_clone refs ==="
  grep -rln "voices\.bailian_clone\|bailian_clone" src apps tests 2>/dev/null
} > .refactor-import-map.txt
cat .refactor-import-map.txt
```

Expected: a complete inventory. Every entry will be addressed in later tasks. **If a site is missed, fix it when ImportError surfaces and amend the originating task.**

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit the import map**

```bash
git add .refactor-import-map.txt
git commit -m "chore: catalog import sites that depend on deletable code"
```

---

## Phase B — Decisive Deletion

> Goal: After Phase B, the repo no longer compiles in places that referenced engine/, local impls, or legacy mode. We fix imports in Phases C–G.

### Task B1: Delete `src/opentalking/engine/` entirely

**Files:**
- Delete: `src/opentalking/engine/` (whole directory)

- [ ] **Step 1: Remove the directory**

```bash
git rm -r src/opentalking/engine
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "refactor: remove src/opentalking/engine (FlashTalk local inference)"
```

Expected: import errors will appear when running tests. Will be fixed in Phase C/E.

---

### Task B2: Delete local-inference files inside `src/opentalking/models/`

**Files:**
- Delete: `src/opentalking/models/flashtalk/local_adapter.py`, `local_client.py`, `idle_generator.py`
- Delete: `src/opentalking/models/musetalk/{adapter,composer,face_utils,feature_extractor,inference,loader,prepared_assets}.py`
- Delete: `src/opentalking/models/wav2lip/{adapter,audio,face_detection,feature_extractor,layers,loader,model_defs,network,official_runtime}.py`
- Keep: `src/opentalking/models/flashtalk/ws_client.py` (will become omnirt client base in Phase E)
- Keep: `src/opentalking/models/flashhead/{http_client.py,ws_client.py}` (already pure clients)
- Keep: `src/opentalking/models/common/frame_avatar.py` (move to media/ later)

- [ ] **Step 1: Delete the files**

```bash
git rm src/opentalking/models/flashtalk/local_adapter.py \
       src/opentalking/models/flashtalk/local_client.py \
       src/opentalking/models/flashtalk/idle_generator.py
git rm src/opentalking/models/musetalk/adapter.py \
       src/opentalking/models/musetalk/composer.py \
       src/opentalking/models/musetalk/face_utils.py \
       src/opentalking/models/musetalk/feature_extractor.py \
       src/opentalking/models/musetalk/inference.py \
       src/opentalking/models/musetalk/loader.py \
       src/opentalking/models/musetalk/prepared_assets.py
git rm src/opentalking/models/wav2lip/adapter.py \
       src/opentalking/models/wav2lip/audio.py \
       src/opentalking/models/wav2lip/face_detection.py \
       src/opentalking/models/wav2lip/feature_extractor.py \
       src/opentalking/models/wav2lip/layers.py \
       src/opentalking/models/wav2lip/loader.py \
       src/opentalking/models/wav2lip/model_defs.py \
       src/opentalking/models/wav2lip/network.py \
       src/opentalking/models/wav2lip/official_runtime.py
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "refactor: remove local model implementations (musetalk/wav2lip/flashtalk-local)"
```

---

### Task B3: Delete root-level cruft

**Files:**
- Delete: `multitalk_utils.py`, `demo/` (mp4 / png test media), `images/` (non-doc images), `.env.flashtalk.example`, `.env.local.example`
- Keep: `images/qq_group_qrcode.png` if README links to it — verify first.

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify which images are referenced by README**

```bash
grep -E "images/" README.md README.en.md 2>/dev/null
```

Expected: list of referenced images. Move them to `docs/assets/images/` if any.

- [ ] **Step 2: Move referenced images, delete the rest**

```bash
mkdir -p docs/assets/images
# For each image referenced by README, move it (run this for each match):
# git mv images/<file> docs/assets/images/<file>
# Then update README:
# sed -i.bak 's|images/<file>|docs/assets/images/<file>|g' README.md README.en.md && rm README.md.bak README.en.md.bak
git rm -r --ignore-unmatch images demo multitalk_utils.py .env.flashtalk.example .env.local.example
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: remove demo media, multitalk_utils, duplicate env examples"
```

---

### Task B4: Delete `src/opentalking/configs/` (duplicate config tree)

**Files:**
- Delete: `src/opentalking/configs/` (whole directory — duplicates root `configs/`)

- [ ] **Step 1: Diff the two trees, merge anything missing into root configs/**

```bash
diff -ru configs src/opentalking/configs || true
```

Expected: identify any unique-to-src content (e.g. `models/musetalk.yaml`, `models/wav2lip.yaml` that root `configs/` may not have). Copy them to `configs/synthesis/` (create dir).

- [ ] **Step 2: Move per-model yamls to root configs/synthesis/**

```bash
mkdir -p configs/synthesis
for f in src/opentalking/configs/models/*.yaml; do
  cp "$f" configs/synthesis/
done
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Remove the duplicate tree and adjust `package-data` in pyproject.toml**

```bash
git rm -r src/opentalking/configs
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Update `pyproject.toml`**

Open `pyproject.toml`, remove the line:

```toml
[tool.setuptools.package-data]
opentalking = ["configs/**/*.yaml"]
```

(There is no longer a `src/opentalking/configs` to ship as package data; runtime config comes from the root `configs/` directory and is read via env var `OPENTALKING_CONFIG_DIR`.)

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add configs/synthesis pyproject.toml
git rm -r --ignore-unmatch src/opentalking/configs
git commit -m "refactor: consolidate configs to root configs/, drop src duplicate"
```

---

### Task B5: Strip `OPENTALKING_FLASHTALK_MODE` from settings and routes

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/opentalking/core/config.py` — remove `flashtalk_mode` field
- Modify: `src/opentalking/models/registry.py` — drop legacy mode branches
- Modify: `apps/api/routes/models.py`, `apps/api/routes/sessions.py`, `apps/api/tests/test_sessions.py`, `src/opentalking/worker/task_consumer.py` — remove all references

- [ ] **Step 1: Locate every reference**

```bash
grep -rn "FLASHTALK_MODE\|flashtalk_mode" src apps configs tests
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Remove the field from `src/opentalking/core/config.py`**

Open the file, delete the line declaring `flashtalk_mode: ...` (typically `flashtalk_mode: Literal["local", "remote", "off"] = "remote"`). If any nested logic depends on it (search for `settings.flashtalk_mode` or `cfg.flashtalk_mode`), replace those branches with the omnirt-only path (delete `local` / `off` branches).

- [ ] **Step 3: Update `models/registry.py`**

Delete the `if mode == "local": ...` branches; the registry will be replaced entirely in Phase E. For now, comment-out (`pass`-stub) any function that becomes unreachable so the module still imports.

- [ ] **Step 4: Update API routes and tests**

In `apps/api/routes/models.py` and `routes/sessions.py`, remove `flashtalk_mode` from response payloads and request schemas. In `apps/api/tests/test_sessions.py`, remove or adjust assertions that reference it.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify no references remain**

```bash
grep -rn "FLASHTALK_MODE\|flashtalk_mode" src apps configs tests
```

Expected: no output.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the still-runnable tests**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit -q --tb=line
```

Expected: smoke / config / TTS tests pass; engine-dependent tests will fail (will be fixed in Phase E). Note failing test names.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: drop OPENTALKING_FLASHTALK_MODE legacy switch"
```

---

### Task B6: Delete legacy server modules

**Files:**
- Delete: `src/opentalking/server/_legacy.py`
- Delete: `src/opentalking/server/__main__.py`, `worker_loop.py`, `runtime.py`, `idle_cache.py`, `video_codec.py`, `broadcast.py`, `ws_server.py` — all import `engine.*` heavily; functionality is being absorbed into `apps/api/` + `packages/opentalking/runtime/` in Phase G.
- Keep (do not delete yet, will move): nothing — `src/opentalking/server/` is fully redundant with `apps/api/`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm `apps/api/` is the live HTTP entry point**

```bash
grep -E "opentalking-(api|worker|unified)" pyproject.toml
```

Expected: scripts point at `apps.api.main:main` and `opentalking.worker.main:main`. The `src/opentalking/server/` tree is dead weight.

- [ ] **Step 2: Delete the directory**

```bash
git rm -r src/opentalking/server
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "refactor: remove dead src/opentalking/server (superseded by apps/api)"
```

---

### Task B7: Delete `apps/cli/` duplicates

**Files:**
- Delete: `apps/cli/` (`download_models.py`, `generate_video.py`, `gradio_app.py` are duplicated in `src/opentalking/cli/`)
- Modify: `pyproject.toml` — change `opentalking-download` script entry to `opentalking.cli.download_models:main`

- [ ] **Step 1: Diff the two cli trees**

```bash
diff -r apps/cli src/opentalking/cli || true
```

Note any divergence; resolve in favor of the version with omnirt awareness (likely `src/opentalking/cli/`). If `apps/cli` has unique fixes, port them.

- [ ] **Step 2: Delete `apps/cli/`**

```bash
git rm -r apps/cli
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Update `pyproject.toml` script entry**

In `[project.scripts]`, change:

```toml
opentalking-download = "apps.cli.download_models:main"
```

to:

```toml
opentalking-download = "opentalking.cli.download_models:main"
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: drop apps/cli duplicates in favor of src/opentalking/cli"
```

---

### Task B8: Delete `apps/worker/` empty shell + drop `voices/bailian_clone.py`

**Files:**
- Move tests: `apps/worker/tests/test_task_consumer.py` → `tests/unit/test_task_consumer.py`
- Delete: `apps/worker/`
- Delete: `src/opentalking/voices/bailian_clone.py` (relocates to `providers/tts/dashscope/clone.py` in Phase D)

- [ ] **Step 1: Move worker tests**

```bash
git mv apps/worker/tests/test_task_consumer.py tests/unit/test_task_consumer.py
git rm -r apps/worker
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Stash bailian_clone for later relocation**

```bash
mkdir -p .refactor-stash
git mv src/opentalking/voices/bailian_clone.py .refactor-stash/bailian_clone.py
```

(`.refactor-stash/` is an in-tree scratch dir, deleted at end of plan.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: remove apps/worker shell, stash bailian_clone for phase D"
```

---

## Phase C — New Skeleton

> Goal: create the empty `packages/opentalking/{core,providers,media,avatar,voice,pipeline,runtime}/` layout. We then **incrementally move existing code into it**, not write it from scratch.

### Task C1: Create the new package skeleton

**Files:**
- Create: empty `__init__.py` in each new directory under `packages/opentalking/`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create directory tree**

```bash
mkdir -p packages/opentalking/{core/{interfaces,types,config,bus},providers/{stt,tts,llm,rtc,synthesis},media,avatar,voice,pipeline/{session,speak,recording},runtime}
find packages/opentalking -type d -exec touch {}/__init__.py \;
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify with tree-style listing**

```bash
find packages/opentalking -type f -name "__init__.py" | sort
```

Expected: ~20 `__init__.py` files.

- [ ] **Step 3: Update `pyproject.toml` to include both src layouts**

Open `pyproject.toml`, find `[tool.setuptools.package-dir]`. Change:

```toml
[tool.setuptools.package-dir]
"" = "src"
"apps" = "apps"
```

to:

```toml
[tool.setuptools.package-dir]
"" = "src"
"apps" = "apps"

[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["src", "packages"]
```

(Both `src/opentalking/...` and `packages/opentalking/...` will resolve as the same package — namespace package — during the migration. By the end of Phase G, `src/opentalking/` is empty and gets deleted.)

Wait — Python namespace packages don't merge two filesystem locations under the same `__init__.py`. To avoid a conflict, **do not** create `packages/opentalking/__init__.py`. Instead, use `pkgutil`-style namespace.

Edit: simpler approach — **do not collide names**. Use `packages/opentalking_v2/` as a temporary import root, and at the end of Phase G we `git mv packages/opentalking_v2 → src/opentalking` after deleting old `src/opentalking/`. Adjust:

```bash
mv packages/opentalking packages/opentalking_v2
```

And update step 3 in `pyproject.toml` accordingly:

```toml
[tool.setuptools.package-dir]
"opentalking" = "src/opentalking"
"opentalking_v2" = "packages/opentalking_v2"
"apps" = "apps"
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to make sure import resolution still works**

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install -e . --no-deps 2>&1 | tail -5
.venv/bin/python -c "import opentalking; import opentalking_v2; print('ok')"
```

Expected: `ok`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "scaffold: create packages/opentalking_v2 skeleton"
```

---

### Task C2: Add `core/interfaces/` Protocol stubs (single source of truth)

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/opentalking_v2/core/interfaces/__init__.py`
- Create: `packages/opentalking_v2/core/interfaces/{stt,tts,llm,rtc,synthesis,avatar_asset}.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write a test asserting the interfaces are importable and define expected methods**

Create `tests/unit/test_v2_interfaces.py`:

```python
from opentalking_v2.core.interfaces import (
    STTAdapter,
    TTSAdapter,
    LLMAdapter,
    RTCAdapter,
    SynthesisAdapter,
    AvatarAsset,
)


def test_protocols_have_expected_methods():
    assert hasattr(STTAdapter, "transcribe")
    assert hasattr(TTSAdapter, "stream_synthesize")
    assert hasattr(LLMAdapter, "stream_chat")
    assert hasattr(RTCAdapter, "create_session")
    assert hasattr(SynthesisAdapter, "stream_audio_to_video")
    assert hasattr(AvatarAsset, "load")
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test and watch it fail**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_v2_interfaces.py -v
```

Expected: `ImportError`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the interfaces**

Create `packages/opentalking_v2/core/interfaces/synthesis.py`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import AsyncIterator, Protocol, runtime_checkable
import numpy as np


@runtime_checkable
class SynthesisAdapter(Protocol):
    """音频流 → 视频帧流的合成适配器。

    所有实现都应是 thin client，背后为外部推理服务（omnirt 等）。

```

Create `packages/opentalking_v2/core/interfaces/llm.py`:

```python

    async def stream_chat(
        self,
        messages: list[dict],
        *,
        system_prompt: str | None = None,
        params: dict | None = None,
    ) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
        ...
```

Create `packages/opentalking_v2/core/interfaces/rtc.py`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import Protocol, runtime_checkable


@runtime_checkable
class RTCAdapter(Protocol):
    async def create_session(self, sdp_offer: str) -> str:
        ...
```

Create `packages/opentalking_v2/core/interfaces/avatar_asset.py`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Protocol, runtime_checkable


@runtime_checkable
class AvatarAsset(Protocol):
    def load(self, asset_dir: Path) -> "AvatarAsset":
        ...
```

Create `packages/opentalking_v2/core/interfaces/__init__.py`:

```python
from .stt import STTAdapter
from .tts import TTSAdapter
from .llm import LLMAdapter
from .rtc import RTCAdapter
from .synthesis import SynthesisAdapter
from .avatar_asset import AvatarAsset

__all__ = [
    "STTAdapter",
    "TTSAdapter",
    "LLMAdapter",
    "RTCAdapter",
    "SynthesisAdapter",
    "AvatarAsset",
]
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_v2_interfaces.py -v
```

Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/opentalking_v2/core/interfaces tests/unit/test_v2_interfaces.py
git commit -m "feat(v2): add core/interfaces protocols (stt/tts/llm/rtc/synthesis/avatar)"
```

### Task C3: Add unified provider registry

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/opentalking_v2/core/registry.py`
- Create: `tests/unit/test_v2_registry.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
# tests/unit/test_v2_registry.py
import pytest
from opentalking_v2.core.registry import register, resolve, list_keys, RegistryError


def test_register_and_resolve():
    @register("tts", "fake-vendor")
    class FakeTTS:
        kind = "tts-fake"

    cls = resolve("tts", "fake-vendor")
    assert cls is FakeTTS


def test_list_keys():
    @register("stt", "alpha")
    class A: ...

    @register("stt", "beta")
    class B: ...

    keys = list_keys("stt")
    assert "alpha" in keys
    assert "beta" in keys


def test_unknown_capability_raises():
    with pytest.raises(RegistryError):
        resolve("nonexistent", "x")


def test_duplicate_registration_raises():
    @register("llm", "dup")
    class L1: ...

    with pytest.raises(RegistryError):
        @register("llm", "dup")
        class L2: ...
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test, watch it fail**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_v2_registry.py -v
```

Expected: ImportError.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement registry**

```python
# packages/opentalking_v2/core/registry.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import Any, Callable


class RegistryError(KeyError):
    pass


_REGISTRY: dict[str, dict[str, Any]] = {}


def register(capability: str, key: str) -> Callable[[Any], Any]:
    def decorator(cls_or_factory):
        bucket = _REGISTRY.setdefault(capability, {})
        if key in bucket:
            raise RegistryError(f"{capability}/{key} already registered")
        bucket[key] = cls_or_factory
        return cls_or_factory
    return decorator


def resolve(capability: str, key: str) -> Any:
    if capability not in _REGISTRY:
        raise RegistryError(f"unknown capability: {capability}")
    if key not in _REGISTRY[capability]:
        raise RegistryError(f"unknown {capability} provider: {key}")
    return _REGISTRY[capability][key]


def list_keys(capability: str) -> list[str]:
    return sorted(_REGISTRY.get(capability, {}).keys())


def _reset_for_tests() -> None:
    _REGISTRY.clear()
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_v2_registry.py -v
```

Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/opentalking_v2/core/registry.py tests/unit/test_v2_registry.py
git commit -m "feat(v2): add provider registry with capability/key namespacing"
```

## Phase D — Move Adapters into `providers/`

> For each existing adapter (TTS, STT, LLM, RTC, voice clone), copy/move into the new layout, register via decorator, and update existing imports.

### Task D1: Move TTS providers

**Files:**
- Move: `src/opentalking/tts/edge/` → `packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/edge/`
- Move: `src/opentalking/tts/dashscope_qwen/` → `packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/dashscope_qwen/`
- Move: `src/opentalking/tts/dashscope_sambert/` → `packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/dashscope_sambert/`
- Move: `src/opentalking/tts/cosyvoice_ws/` → `packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/cosyvoice_ws/`
- Move: `src/opentalking/tts/elevenlabs/` → `packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/elevenlabs/`
- Move: `.refactor-stash/bailian_clone.py` → `packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/dashscope_qwen/clone.py` (or wherever Bailian belongs — verify `bailian_clone` corresponds to the same SDK)
- Move: `src/opentalking/tts/factory.py` + `providers.py` + `edge_zh_voices.py` + `qwen_tts_voices.py` → `packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/`

- [ ] **Step 1: Move directories**

```bash
git mv src/opentalking/tts/edge packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/edge
git mv src/opentalking/tts/dashscope_qwen packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/dashscope_qwen
git mv src/opentalking/tts/dashscope_sambert packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/dashscope_sambert
git mv src/opentalking/tts/cosyvoice_ws packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/cosyvoice_ws
git mv src/opentalking/tts/elevenlabs packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/elevenlabs
git mv src/opentalking/tts/factory.py packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/factory.py
git mv src/opentalking/tts/providers.py packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/providers.py
git mv src/opentalking/tts/edge_zh_voices.py packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/edge_zh_voices.py
git mv src/opentalking/tts/qwen_tts_voices.py packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/qwen_tts_voices.py
git mv .refactor-stash/bailian_clone.py packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/dashscope_qwen/clone.py
git rm src/opentalking/tts/__init__.py
```

(After move, `src/opentalking/tts/` is gone.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Mass-update imports**

```bash
# Find all references to opentalking.tts and rewrite to opentalking_v2.providers.tts
grep -rl "opentalking\.tts" src apps tests | xargs sed -i.bak 's/opentalking\.tts/opentalking_v2.providers.tts/g'
find . -name "*.bak" -delete
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Add registration to each adapter `__init__.py`**

For example, `packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/edge/__init__.py` add:

```python
from opentalking_v2.core.registry import register
from .adapter import EdgeTTSAdapter  # whatever the existing class is

register("tts", "edge")(EdgeTTSAdapter)
```

Repeat for `dashscope_qwen`, `dashscope_sambert`, `cosyvoice_ws`, `elevenlabs`. **Inspect each subdir to find the actual class name first**:

```bash
grep -E "^class .*TTS" packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/edge/*.py
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Bootstrap all TTS providers from package `__init__.py`**

Create / update `packages/opentalking_v2/providers/tts/__init__.py`:

```python
"""Importing this package auto-registers all TTS providers."""
from . import edge  # noqa: F401
from . import dashscope_qwen  # noqa: F401
from . import dashscope_sambert  # noqa: F401
from . import cosyvoice_ws  # noqa: F401
from . import elevenlabs  # noqa: F401
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run TTS tests**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_tts_factory.py tests/unit/test_edge_tts_adapter.py apps/api/tests/test_tts_preview.py -v
```

Expected: PASS. If failing due to import paths inside moved code (relative imports broke), fix them.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor(v2): move TTS providers + register via core.registry"
```

---

### Task D2: Move STT, LLM, RTC providers (same pattern)

**Files:**
- Move: `src/opentalking/stt/dashscope_asr.py` → `packages/opentalking_v2/providers/stt/dashscope/adapter.py`
- Move: `src/opentalking/llm/{conversation,openai_compatible,sentence_splitter}.py` → `packages/opentalking_v2/providers/llm/openai_compatible/`
- Move: `src/opentalking/rtc/aiortc_adapter.py` → `packages/opentalking_v2/providers/rtc/aiortc/adapter.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Move files**

```bash
mkdir -p packages/opentalking_v2/providers/stt/dashscope
mkdir -p packages/opentalking_v2/providers/llm/openai_compatible
mkdir -p packages/opentalking_v2/providers/rtc/aiortc
git mv src/opentalking/stt/dashscope_asr.py packages/opentalking_v2/providers/stt/dashscope/adapter.py
touch packages/opentalking_v2/providers/stt/dashscope/__init__.py
git mv src/opentalking/llm/openai_compatible.py packages/opentalking_v2/providers/llm/openai_compatible/adapter.py
git mv src/opentalking/llm/conversation.py packages/opentalking_v2/providers/llm/openai_compatible/conversation.py
git mv src/opentalking/llm/sentence_splitter.py packages/opentalking_v2/providers/llm/openai_compatible/sentence_splitter.py
touch packages/opentalking_v2/providers/llm/openai_compatible/__init__.py
git mv src/opentalking/rtc/aiortc_adapter.py packages/opentalking_v2/providers/rtc/aiortc/adapter.py
touch packages/opentalking_v2/providers/rtc/aiortc/__init__.py
git rm src/opentalking/stt/__init__.py src/opentalking/llm/__init__.py src/opentalking/rtc/__init__.py
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Mass-update imports**

```bash
grep -rl "opentalking\.stt\|opentalking\.llm\|opentalking\.rtc" src apps tests | xargs sed -i.bak \
  -e 's|opentalking\.stt\.dashscope_asr|opentalking_v2.providers.stt.dashscope.adapter|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.stt|opentalking_v2.providers.stt|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.llm\.openai_compatible|opentalking_v2.providers.llm.openai_compatible.adapter|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.llm\.conversation|opentalking_v2.providers.llm.openai_compatible.conversation|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.llm\.sentence_splitter|opentalking_v2.providers.llm.openai_compatible.sentence_splitter|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.llm|opentalking_v2.providers.llm|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.rtc\.aiortc_adapter|opentalking_v2.providers.rtc.aiortc.adapter|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.rtc|opentalking_v2.providers.rtc|g'
find . -name "*.bak" -delete
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Add registration calls in each `__init__.py`**

For each provider, find the class name (`grep -E "^class " <file>`) and add a `register("<capability>", "<key>")(Class)` line.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run unit tests**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_aiortc_adapter.py -v
```

Expected: PASS (or fix relative imports if broken).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor(v2): move STT/LLM/RTC providers and register them"
```

## Phase E — Avatar Aggregate (minimum viable)

> Full schema is in architecture-review § 七.5. For Week 1 we ship a minimum that loads existing `examples/avatars/<id>/manifest.json` and exposes them via the existing `/avatars` API. Schema enrichment (identity / brain / behavior fields) lands in Week 2.

## Phase F — Move pipeline / runtime / core

### Task F1: Move worker code to `packages/opentalking_v2/runtime` and `pipeline`

**Files:**
- Move: `src/opentalking/worker/{main,server,task_consumer,session_runner,bus,timing,text_sanitize}.py` → `packages/opentalking_v2/runtime/`
- Move: `src/opentalking/worker/{flashtalk_runner,flashtalk_recording,flashtalk_offline_export}.py` → `packages/opentalking_v2/pipeline/speak/` (rename to drop "flashtalk_" prefix where the file is now provider-agnostic; keep recording/offline_export names)
- Move: `src/opentalking/worker/pipeline/{audio_pipeline,render_pipeline}.py` → `packages/opentalking_v2/pipeline/speak/`

- [ ] **Step 1: Move**

git rm -r src/opentalking/worker
mkdir -p packages/opentalking_v2/pipeline/recording
touch packages/opentalking_v2/pipeline/recording/__init__.py
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Update pyproject script entry**

In `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
opentalking-worker = "opentalking_v2.runtime.main:main"
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Mass-update imports**

```bash
grep -rl "opentalking\.worker\|opentalking\.pipeline" src apps tests packages | xargs sed -i.bak \
  -e 's|opentalking\.worker\.flashtalk_runner|opentalking_v2.pipeline.speak.synthesis_runner|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.worker\.flashtalk_recording|opentalking_v2.pipeline.recording.recording|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.worker\.flashtalk_offline_export|opentalking_v2.pipeline.recording.offline_export|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.worker\.session_runner|opentalking_v2.pipeline.session.runner|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.worker\.task_consumer|opentalking_v2.runtime.task_consumer|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.worker\.bus|opentalking_v2.runtime.bus|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.worker\.timing|opentalking_v2.runtime.timing|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.worker\.text_sanitize|opentalking_v2.pipeline.speak.text_sanitize|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.worker\.pipeline|opentalking_v2.pipeline.speak|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.worker|opentalking_v2.runtime|g'
find . -name "*.bak" -delete
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Inside `synthesis_runner.py`, fix any FlashTalk-specific class/function names that still reference deleted local code**

Open the file and:
- Replace any `from opentalking.engine import ...` with `raise NotImplementedError("local engine removed; use omnirt path")` for now (deeper refactor in Week 2 plan).
- Remove direct local-adapter instantiation; the runner should accept a `SynthesisAdapter` instance from the registry.

This is the largest single remediation; **commit a temporary stub** that compiles but raises if a code path needs the deleted engine. Smoke tests (no actual inference) will still pass.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run task_consumer + smoke tests**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_task_consumer.py tests/unit/test_smoke.py -v
```

Expected: PASS or skip (mark engine-dependent paths as `pytest.skip("requires omnirt")` rather than failing).

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor(v2): relocate worker into pipeline + runtime layers"
```

### Task F2: Move core pieces to v2

**Files:**
- Move: `src/opentalking/core/*` → `packages/opentalking_v2/core/`

- [ ] **Step 1: Move (preserving the new sub-structure)**

```bash
git mv src/opentalking/core/bus.py packages/opentalking_v2/core/bus/__init__.py
git mv src/opentalking/core/in_memory_redis.py packages/opentalking_v2/core/bus/in_memory_redis.py
git mv src/opentalking/core/config.py packages/opentalking_v2/core/config/__init__.py
git mv src/opentalking/core/model_config.py packages/opentalking_v2/core/config/model_config.py
git mv src/opentalking/core/queue_status.py packages/opentalking_v2/core/queue_status.py
git mv src/opentalking/core/redis_keys.py packages/opentalking_v2/core/redis_keys.py
git mv src/opentalking/core/session_store.py packages/opentalking_v2/core/session_store.py
git mv src/opentalking/core/types/events.py packages/opentalking_v2/core/types/events.py
git mv src/opentalking/core/types/frames.py packages/opentalking_v2/core/types/frames.py
git mv src/opentalking/core/types/__init__.py packages/opentalking_v2/core/types/__init__.py
# core/interfaces is already in v2 (Task C2). Discard the old one to avoid clash:
git rm src/opentalking/core/interfaces/avatar_asset.py \
       src/opentalking/core/interfaces/llm_adapter.py \
       src/opentalking/core/interfaces/model_adapter.py \
       src/opentalking/core/interfaces/render_session.py \
       src/opentalking/core/interfaces/tts_adapter.py \
       src/opentalking/core/interfaces/__init__.py
git rm src/opentalking/core/__init__.py
rmdir src/opentalking/core/types src/opentalking/core/interfaces src/opentalking/core 2>/dev/null || true
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Mass-update imports**

```bash
grep -rl "opentalking\.core" src apps tests packages | xargs sed -i.bak \
  -e 's|opentalking\.core\.bus|opentalking_v2.core.bus|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.core\.in_memory_redis|opentalking_v2.core.bus.in_memory_redis|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.core\.config|opentalking_v2.core.config|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.core\.model_config|opentalking_v2.core.config.model_config|g' \

  -e 's|opentalking\.core\.interfaces|opentalking_v2.core.interfaces|g' \
  -e 's|opentalking\.core|opentalking_v2.core|g'
find . -name "*.bak" -delete
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run tests**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_in_memory_redis.py tests/unit/test_model_config.py tests/unit/test_smoke.py apps/api/tests/test_config.py -v
```

Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor(v2): move core (bus/config/types) to packages/opentalking_v2"
```

---

### Task F3: Final renames — collapse `opentalking_v2` → `opentalking`, delete `src/opentalking/`

**Files:**
- Delete: `src/opentalking/` (must be empty by now apart from `version.py`, `__init__.py`, `cli/`)
- Rename: `packages/opentalking_v2` → `packages/opentalking`

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify what's left**

```bash
find src/opentalking -type f
```

Expected: just `__init__.py`, `version.py`, possibly `cli/`. Move the survivors:

```bash
mkdir -p packages/opentalking_v2/cli
git mv src/opentalking/version.py packages/opentalking_v2/version.py
git mv src/opentalking/cli/* packages/opentalking_v2/cli/ 2>/dev/null || true
git mv src/opentalking/__init__.py packages/opentalking_v2/__init__.py
git rm -r src/opentalking
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Rename the v2 root to the final name**

```bash
git mv packages/opentalking_v2 packages/opentalking
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Mass-update all `opentalking_v2` references back to `opentalking`**

```bash
grep -rl "opentalking_v2" packages apps tests pyproject.toml configs | xargs sed -i.bak 's|opentalking_v2|opentalking|g'
find . -name "*.bak" -delete
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Update pyproject `package-dir`**

```toml
[tool.setuptools.package-dir]
"opentalking" = "packages/opentalking"
"apps" = "apps"
```

Remove the `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` block if it was added.

- [ ] **Step 5: Update script entries**

```toml
opentalking-worker = "opentalking.runtime.main:main"
opentalking-download = "opentalking.cli.download_models:main"
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Reinstall and run all tests**

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install -e . --no-deps 2>&1 | tail -5
.venv/bin/pytest tests apps/api/tests -q --tb=line 2>&1 | tail -20
```

Expected: pass count ≥ baseline minus the engine-dependent tests we explicitly skipped.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: collapse opentalking_v2 → opentalking, delete legacy src/opentalking"
```

---

## Phase G — apps/api consolidation

### Task G1: Verify apps/api still works after import rewrites

**Files:**
- Modify (only if broken): `apps/api/main.py`, `apps/api/routes/*.py`, `apps/api/services/*.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Boot the API in unified mode**

```bash
OPENTALKING_REDIS_MODE=memory .venv/bin/python -m apps.api.main &
API_PID=$!
sleep 3
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/health || (kill $API_PID; exit 1)
kill $API_PID 2>/dev/null || true
```

Expected: `/health` returns 200.

- [ ] **Step 2: Fix any ImportError surfaced**

If imports fail, search/replace the offending references — most should already be handled by Phase D/F sed-fests, but double check `apps/api/services/worker_service.py` and `apps/api/routes/sessions.py`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run API test suite**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest apps/api/tests -v
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit any fixes**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix(api): adjust imports after refactor" --allow-empty
```

- [ ] **Step 9: Replace old top-level `scripts/start_server.sh`, `start_unified.sh`, `download_models.sh` (legacy)**

```bash
git rm -f scripts/start_server.sh scripts/start_unified.sh scripts/download_models.sh scripts/deploy_ascend_910b.sh
```

(Keep `scripts/prepare-avatar.sh` if it is still useful; otherwise remove.)

- [ ] **Step 10: Commit**

```bash
git add scripts
git commit -m "feat: one-click install/up/down + omnirt health check"
```

## Phase I — Smoke E2E

### Task I1: Run full unit + apps test suites

- [ ] **Step 1: Run everything**

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests apps/api/tests -v --tb=short 2>&1 | tee .post-refactor-pytest.txt | tail -30
```

Expected: total pass count ≥ baseline pass count minus tests we explicitly removed (any tests that exercised deleted local engine code). Compare with `.baseline-pytest.txt`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run ruff and fix anything trivial**

```bash
.venv/bin/ruff check packages apps tests 2>&1 | tee .post-refactor-ruff.txt | tail -20
.venv/bin/ruff check --fix packages apps tests || true
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Boot the API in unified/memory mode and curl /health**

```bash
OPENTALKING_REDIS_MODE=memory .venv/bin/python -m apps.api.main &
API_PID=$!
sleep 3
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/health
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/avatars
kill $API_PID 2>/dev/null || true
```

Expected: both endpoints respond 200 with the new code paths.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit any final fixes**

```bash
git add -A
git diff --cached --stat
git commit -m "fix: post-refactor lint/test cleanup" --allow-empty
```

## Phase J — Documentation

### Task J1: Replace `docs/architecture.md` pointer

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/architecture.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Rewrite `docs/architecture.md` to a thin overview that points at the review doc**

```markdown
# Architecture (current)

OpenTalking is composed of:

- **apps/api** — FastAPI HTTP entry (sessions, avatars, SSE)
- **apps/worker** *(deprecated; replaced by `opentalking.runtime`)*
- **apps/web** — React control console
- **packages/opentalking/** — library code:
  - `core/` — interfaces, registry, types, config, bus
  - `providers/{stt,tts,llm,rtc,synthesis}/` — capability adapters (synthesis routes through omnirt)
  - `avatar/`, `voice/` — asset stores (filesystem)
  - `pipeline/{session,speak,recording}/` — orchestration
  - `runtime/` — task consumer / process bootstrap
- **omnirt** — external multimodal inference runtime ([repo](https://github.com/datascale-ai/omnirt))

For the design rationale, target layout, decisions, and migration plan, see
[architecture-review.md](architecture-review.md).
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Delete `docs/flashtalk-omnirt.md` and `docs/flashtalk-omnirt.en.md`**

```bash
git rm -f docs/flashtalk-omnirt.md docs/flashtalk-omnirt.en.md
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: refresh architecture.md, drop flashtalk-omnirt.md"
```

---

### Task J2: New top-level README

**Files:**
- Modify: `README.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Replace README content**

Replace the current README with:

```markdown
# OpenTalking

> 实时陪伴型数字人开源框架 · 一键部署 · 自定义形象/音色/性格

## ✨ 核心能力

- 🎭 **可配置数字人**：形象 / 音色 / 性格 / 技能四维度自定义
- ⚡ **实时交互**：< 2s 首响，支持中途打断
- 🔧 **多硬件**：3090 / 4090 / 910B / CPU 同一套架构
- 🎯 **分层模型**：默认轻量（数百 MB），可选高质量（FlashTalk 14B）
- 🔌 **解耦推理**：基于 [omnirt](https://github.com/datascale-ai/omnirt) 推理服务，扩展模型零侵入

## 🚀 快速开始（3 行命令）

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<org>/opentalking && cd opentalking
cp .env.example .env                  # 按需填 STT/LLM 凭据
bash scripts/install.sh               # 自动探测硬件 + 拉起所有服务
```

打开 http://localhost:5173 选择内置 avatar 即可对话。

## 📐 架构总览

OpenTalking = **业务编排（本仓）** + **推理服务（omnirt）** + **前端控制台**

所有模型推理（FlashTalk / MuseTalk / Wav2Lip / TTS / 音色克隆）由 omnirt 承担。

详细设计见 [docs/architecture-review.md](docs/architecture-review.md)。

## 🎨 自定义数字人

1. 进入"角色管理 → 新建"
2. 上传一张参考图（建议正面、肩部以上）
3. 选择合成模型（musetalk / flashtalk / wav2lip）
4. 选择音色（preset 或上传 30s 音频克隆）
5. 写角色 prompt（例："你是一个温柔的语言教师..."）
6. 保存 → 在主页选中 → 开始对话

## 🛠 部署形态

| 形态 | 命令 | 适用 |
|---|---|---|
| Docker（推荐） | `bash scripts/install.sh docker` | 生产 / 一键体验 |
| Native | `bash scripts/install.sh native` | 开发 |
| Dev unified | `docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml up` | 前端联调 |

## 🖥 硬件 profile

| profile | 默认合成模型 | 备注 |
|---|---|---|
| cuda-4090 | musetalk | FlashTalk 可选下载 |
| cuda-3090 | wav2lip | 体积小，跑得动 |
| ascend-910b | flashtalk | 高质量首选 |
| cpu-demo | wav2lip | 仅功能验证 |

## Final Verification Checklist

Run these commands and confirm each ✅ before declaring done:

- [ ] `find src/opentalking -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l` → **0** (whole tree gone)
- [ ] `find packages/opentalking -type d` shows: `core,providers,media,avatar,voice,pipeline,runtime` (and their children)
- [ ] `grep -rn "FLASHTALK_MODE\|opentalking_v2\|opentalking\.engine\|opentalking\.models" packages apps tests` → no matches
- [ ] `.venv/bin/pytest tests apps/api/tests -q` → pass count ≥ baseline minus engine-deleted tests
- [ ] `bash -n scripts/install.sh scripts/up.sh scripts/down.sh` → no shell syntax errors
- [ ] `docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.cuda.yml config >/dev/null` → valid (if docker installed)
- [ ] `OPENTALKING_REDIS_MODE=memory .venv/bin/python -m apps.api.main &` then `curl localhost:8000/health` → 200
- [ ] `cat .env.example | grep -c '^[A-Z]'` → ≥ 12 vars present
- [ ] `ls configs/profiles | wc -l` → 4 profiles
- [ ] `cat configs/inference/omnirt.yaml | grep -c "task:"` → ≥ 4 task entries
- [ ] `git log --oneline refactor/architecture-v2 ^main | wc -l` → ≥ 25 commits (one per task)
- [ ] README has been rewritten (not the old FlashTalk-centric one)

## Out of Scope (separate plans)

- Catalog API + frontend dropdown wiring (`GET /catalog/*`) — needed for UI provider selection.
- Deep split of `pipeline/speak/synthesis_runner.py` (the moved-from-flashtalk_runner) into clean stages — currently a single 2528-line file moved as-is. Tracked as Week 2 task.
- Avatar manifest schema enrichment (identity / brain / behavior fields beyond minimum) — Week 2.
- Windows install path — June.
- Benchmark CI — Week 3.
- Docker images for ascend / cpu — Week 2.
- ports/dns/security hardening of compose — Week 3.
