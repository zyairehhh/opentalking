## Overview

OpenTalking is an open-source orchestration framework for real-time digital-human conversations. It covers the core path of a **digital-human conversational product**: frontend interaction, session state, LLM replies, STT, TTS and voice selection, interruption control, subtitle events, WebRTC audio/video playback, and calls into local or remote model services.

OpenTalking is designed as a practical digital-human production stack. The WebUI, avatar and voice asset libraries, knowledge bases, memory, multi-session state, LLM / STT / TTS providers, WebRTC playback, and model backends are organized in one project. You can start with the lightweight Mock mode, connect local QuickTalk / Wav2Lip, or use OmniRT for FlashTalk, FasterLivePortrait, and other higher-quality or more complex model workflows.

- **Fast trial**: `mock / driverless mode`, useful for validating the API, TTS, and WebRTC path before downloading video model weights.
- **Real-time conversation**: connect `QuickTalk`, `Wav2Lip`, `FlashTalk`, and other models for interactive digital-human dialogue.
- **Video creation and cloning**: reuse FasterLivePortrait runtime for audio/text-driven video creation and camera/uploaded-video-driven video clone workflows.
- **Private deployment**: supports local STT/TTS, OpenAI-compatible LLMs, knowledge bases, memory, OmniRT remote inference, Docker, and distributed deployment.

## WebUI And Demos

OpenTalking provides a Web service interface for managing the digital-human conversation pipeline. You can select or create avatars, configure voices, LLM, TTS, STT, and digital-human driver models, inspect model connection status, and validate real-time conversation, subtitles, and audio/video playback on the same page.

## Choose A Deployment Path

OpenTalking's **orchestration layer** (API / Worker / frontend) and **digital-human synthesis backend** (`mock`, `local`, `direct_ws`, or [OmniRT](https://github.com/datascale-ai/omnirt)) can be deployed independently. If you are new to the project, start with Mock mode to validate the full path, then switch to a real rendering model based on your GPU, model, and private-deployment requirements.

| Path | Recommended model / backend | Device reference | Best for | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fast trial | `mock` | CPU / no GPU | Validate API, LLM, TTS, WebRTC, and browser playback without downloading model weights | [Quickstart](https://datascale-ai.github.io/opentalking/latest/en/quick-start/) |
| Entry validation | `quicktalk` / `wav2lip` | RTX 3050 Laptop, RTX 3060, RTX 4060 | Run real video rendering for demos and deployment validation; lower the resolution on low-memory devices | [QuickTalk](https://datascale-ai.github.io/opentalking/latest/en/avatar_models/deployment/quicktalk-local/) / [Wav2Lip](https://datascale-ai.github.io/opentalking/latest/en/avatar_models/deployment/wav2lip-local/) |
| Consumer-GPU single machine | `quicktalk` / `wav2lip` / `musetalk` | RTX 3090, RTX 4090 | Closer to real-time local demos, private validation, and lightweight pre-production evaluation | [Model and backend selection](https://datascale-ai.github.io/opentalking/latest/en/model-support/selection/) |
| Fully local private path | `sensevoice` + `local_cosyvoice` + `quicktalk` | RTX 3090 / 4090 or similar GPU | Run STT, TTS, and video driving locally; OpenTalking uses the main `.venv`, while CosyVoice runs in a dedicated sidecar venv | [Local STT/TTS + QuickTalk](https://datascale-ai.github.io/opentalking/latest/en/recipes/local-quicktalk-audio/) |
| High-quality remote inference | `flashtalk` / `flashhead` / `fasterliveportrait` + OmniRT | Multi-GPU, Ascend 910B2, remote GPU service | Multi-card, GPU/NPU, production isolation, higher visual quality, or video clone workflows | [FlashTalk](https://datascale-ai.github.io/opentalking/latest/en/avatar_models/flashtalk/) / [FasterLivePortrait](https://datascale-ai.github.io/opentalking/latest/en/avatar_models/fasterliveportrait/) |
| Docker / production deployment | API, Web, Worker, external model services | Single GPU, remote GPU, distributed cluster | Service deployment, remote GPU, distributed runtime, and production validation | [Deployment](https://datascale-ai.github.io/opentalking/latest/en/deployment/) |

## Quickstart

Choose one of the two quickstart paths first:

| Path | Use when | What you need | What it validates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compshare image | You want to try OpenTalking before setting up dependencies or downloading model weights. | A Compshare instance created from the published image, with port `5173` open. | WebUI, LLM replies, streaming TTS, subtitle events, WebRTC delivery, and the prebuilt image workflow. |
| Self deployment | You want to run the repo on your own machine or server, customize config, or continue into local/remote model deployment. | Python, Node.js, FFmpeg, `.env` provider config; real models also need GPU/runtime/model weights. | Mock first-run path, then local QuickTalk or remote OmniRT model paths. |

### 1. Compshare Image

If you want to try the OpenTalking + OmniRT + QuickTalk real-time digital-human path before setting up everything manually, use the community image we published on Compshare:

- Image URL: [image link](https://www.compshare.cn/images/TdDwmKZUZebI?referral_code=Hid5KUhcqlZEptmMEwKy2F)
- Exposed port: `5173` (WebUI; API traffic is proxied internally)
- Guide: [Compshare image quick experience](https://datascale-ai.github.io/opentalking/latest/en/quick-start/)

The image includes OpenTalking, OmniRT, the QuickTalk runtime environment, and model files. After deploying an instance, open port `5173` and visit the instance URL provided by the platform. If you need to restart services manually, follow the commands in the guide.

### 2. Self Deployment

Use this path when you want to run OpenTalking from source. Start with Mock mode if you do not want to download video model weights yet: Mock mode uses the built-in static frame, while LLM replies, streaming TTS, subtitle events, and WebRTC delivery still run through the full product path.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datascale-ai/opentalking.git
cd opentalking

uv sync --extra dev --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and configure at least an LLM. The default TTS can use the keyless `edge` voice. LLM, STT, and TTS are independent providers; see [Configuration](https://datascale-ai.github.io/opentalking/latest/en/reference/configuration/) and [LLM / STT](https://datascale-ai.github.io/opentalking/latest/en/speech_models/llm-stt/).

```bash
bash scripts/start_unified.sh --mock
```

The default frontend URL is `http://localhost:5173`. To specify ports:

```bash
bash scripts/start_unified.sh --mock --api-port 8210 --web-port 5280
```

Stop services:

```bash
bash scripts/quickstart/stop_all.sh
```

#### Real Model Entrypoints

After Mock mode works, choose a real model path based on your machine. Weight downloads, directory layout, mirrors, checks, and troubleshooting are maintained in the docs; the README keeps only the startup entrypoints:

```bash
# Local QuickTalk: consumer-GPU single-machine path
export OPENTALKING_TORCH_DEVICE=cuda:0
export OPENTALKING_QUICKTALK_ASSET_ROOT="$PWD/models/quicktalk"
export OPENTALKING_QUICKTALK_WORKER_CACHE=1
bash scripts/start_unified.sh --backend local --model quicktalk --api-port 8210 --web-port 5280

# Remote OmniRT / FlashTalk: high-quality or multi-card path
bash scripts/start_unified.sh \
  --backend omnirt \
  --model flashtalk \
  --api-port 8210 \
  --web-port 5280 \
  --omnirt http://<gpu-server>:9000
```

### Cloud Model API: Atlas Cloud

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://www.atlascloud.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=opentalking">
    <img src="docs/assets/images/atlas-cloud-logo.png" alt="Atlas Cloud" width="200">
  </a>
</p>

> **[Atlas Cloud](https://www.atlascloud.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=opentalking)** is an all-modal AI inference platform. One API gives you access to video generation, image generation, and LLMs, so you do not need to integrate multiple vendors separately. A single integration can route to 300+ curated all-modal models.

OpenTalking uses an OpenAI-compatible interface for LLMs. Point `OPENTALKING_LLM_BASE_URL` to `https://api.atlascloud.ai/v1` to use Atlas-hosted DeepSeek / Qwen models. See [LLM and STT](https://datascale-ai.github.io/opentalking/latest/en/speech_models/llm-stt/). For budget-friendly API options, see Atlas Cloud's [coding plan](https://www.atlascloud.ai/console/coding-plan).
